			<p> Our partner institution, SAKADAB, has encountered a number of problematic 
			situations especially on the financial end. This issue has affected many people 
			in the community in a number of ways. The lack of medical supplies is an example 
			as to why financial stability in the community, is important to address. Financial 
			troubles are necessary to solve immediately because it would eventually start to 
			grow and create more other significant problems in the near future. An institution 
			like SAKADAB should be taken care of because once a problem occurs, the whole community
			will most likely be affected also.<br><br>

 This is why we propose an online campaign and fundraiser project, which will help give exposure to 
 our partner community, while at the same time directly and indirectly alleviating their main problem 
 as an institution. One of the reasons why our partner institution has problems financially is because 
 one of their main income sources, donations and selling handicraft and baking products usually come with
 more exposure, which sadly, our partner institution mostly lacks. With added exposure from social media,
 we can help put our partner institution's name on the map while at the same time promoting their products 
 and advocacy. Fundraisers and fundraising events like gift card and food selling can also be done, in order
 to give some financial aid back to a community that has been helping our PWD friends for over a decade now.
 Thats great and all, but, how will this help the community in the first place? Well, we mentioned earlier 
 how the financial struggles of the institution can branch out into other problems in the future. Well, through
 donations, funds collected from fundraising events, and community support, we will be able to put a stop 
 and prevent these future struggles before they even happen, while at the same time being able to increase 
 the quality of life in the SAKADAB institution itself. Through our project, we can also shed light on issues
 such as dissability discrimination in social media, thus spreading awareness on an important issue that many
 residents in the SAKADAB institution face.

The project is important for the institution because it will be able to promote and shed
 light on our partner institutions business and cause, while at the same time helping alleviate
 the financial problems present in SAKADAB, along with the issues that have branched out from it
 like the medical problems due to the lack of medical supplies present in the area. Through promoting
 their institutions business and cause, we give them more exposure, which was the original desire 
 of SAKADAB president Mr. Ludivico Mascarinas Jr., while at the same time spreading awareness about 
 dissability discrimination in the Philippines, thus uniting the country as one productive unit in 
 helping to put a stop to dissability discrimination. Next, we also aim to improve the overall 
 sustainability of the partner institution, by increasing trust and teamwork within the residents
 of SAKADAB. With trust and teamwork chemistry comes sustainability within the community. We can
 also improve the overall quality of life within the institution itself, through donations and funds 
 earned from fundraising activities hosted throughout the school year. Lastly, we also aim to prevent 
 future problems that could branch out from the present financial problems of SAKADAB.</p>

The project is important to us, Group 2B, because the project will help us develop a sense of 
urgency towards the problems not just of our partner institution, but the problems around us 
present in our own community. As Junior High School students, we can learn more about being 
problem-solvers or liberators in real-life, and beyond just essays and forms. We can learn how 
to be liberators in times of crisis in the actual real-world this time. The project is also 
important to us, because we believe that God sent us down to Earth in order to complete a certain
mission to help other people and to collaborate with our neighbors, peers, and fellow human 
beings in times of crisis. Through this project, we become one with the community and we get
one step closer into completing this mission sent out by God. As Jesus said: "You must love 
your neigbor as yourself".</p>

 <h2 class="head">Significance to the Public</h2>

Our project is important to the public in general because our project aims to spread awareness, 
through social media, about not only our partner institution, but about exposing and shedding light
 on issues such as dissability discrimination. This way, the public, or the general population living
 inside and outside of Davao City and the Philippines, will receive more information about dissability
 discrimination and how it affects PWD's in their daily lives. The information dissimination can be 
 done through infographics showing statistics, feature videos of our partner community, and general 
 updates on our social media pages and website.</p>
